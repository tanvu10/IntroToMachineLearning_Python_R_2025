    "# Chapter 00 - Getting Started with Python and Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "In some applications, it's more common to work with Python scripts, we're going to work with a Jupyter Notebook instead. Jupyter notebooks are more interactive, because you can run each line of code manually, and immediately see the result, before moving onto the next line of code. Python scripts are files with self-contained lines of code that are meant to be run automatically without any manual intervention - then you can see all the results at the end. Jupyter Notebooks are just a special type of file that let's you write and run lines of Python code AND write notes about your code or results.  A Jupyter notebook is made up of (mainly) two type of **cells**: **code cells** and **Markdown cells** - which are just blocks of either code or text.  "
